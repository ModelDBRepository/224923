To use run the simulations, the NEURON mechanisms (*.mod) must be compiled.
If NEURON is correctly installed this can be done on Linux and OS X by
opening the folder "hay" in a terminal and writing "nrnivmodl".

You also need LFPy to run the simulations: http://lfpy.github.io/

To reproduce simulation results in Figure 3 and 4, open this folder in a terminal
and write
"python tissue_impedance_impact.py"
