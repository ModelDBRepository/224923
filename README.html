This python package reproduces simulation results from

Level.  Eneuro 4:1-15.

To use run the simulations, the NEURON mechanisms (*.mod) must be
compiled.  If NEURON is correctly installed this can be done on Linux
and OS X by opening the folder "hay" in a terminal and writing
"nrnivmodl".

You also need LFPy to run the simulations: http://lfpy.github.io/

To reproduce simulation results in Figure 3 and 4, open this folder in
a terminal and write

"python tissue_impedance_impact.py"

The following figures (spike.png, synaptic_852.png, and
white_noise.png) will be generated and stored in the top level folder:

<img src="./spike.png" alt="spike.png" width="550">

<img src="./white_noise.png" alt="white_noise.png" width="550">
